This magic armor appears as a pot of bubbling black ichor. When you attune to it, the ichor adheres to and contours to your skin, and the pot disappears. The armor can be worn under normal clothes, and it doesn’t impede bodily functions. Once you put it on, it can’t be removed unless you choose to do so or you die, at which point the pot reappears and the ichor flows back into it.
Plate, heavy armor. 18AC
While wearing the armor, you have resistance to poison damage. The armor also doesn’t impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you're unwilling to part with the armor. Taking it off fails to end the curse. While cursed in this way, you feel disconnected from your body, continuously hearing whispers that call for you to join them. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence. The object and location of this object are chosen by the DM (but might be the House of Cards; see chapter 18). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert and doesn't age or require sustenance. Destroying the object frees your soul; otherwise, only a [Wish](app://obsidian.md/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can restore your soul to your body.
