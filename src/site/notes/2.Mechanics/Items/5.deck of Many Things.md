# Deck of Many Things
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 12*  

A [Deck of Many Things](compendium/items/deck-of-many-things.md) typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.

This approach is particularly useful if you make a [Deck of Many Things](compendium/items/deck-of-many-things.md) the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.

You can grant the following additional magical properties to the cards of the [Deck of Many Things](compendium/items/deck-of-many-things.md):

## Cards

### Fool
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/01-fool.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or for the next minute, the target can't cast spells or activate magic items, it has disadvantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have resistance to all damage it deals. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Key
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/02-key.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Knock](compendium/spells/knock.md) spell, with no sound made by the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all expended uses at dawn.

### Balance
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/03-balance.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and drain its life force. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take `4d8` necrotic damage. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage the target takes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Puzzle
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/04-puzzle.webp#card)
As an action, you can hold this card aloft and magically disable each trap within 60 feet of you that isn't behind "total cover". A trap, for the purpose of this property, includes any object or mechanism that would inflict a sudden effect that was intended by its maker to cause harm or inconvenience. If the trap is the effect of a spell, such as [Alarm](compendium/spells/alarm.md), that trap is suppressed for 10 minutes instead of being disabled. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Gem
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/05-gem.webp#card)
This card holds one 6th-level spell (chosen by the DM). As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the spell stored inside (spell attack bonus +9, save DC 17). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Rogue
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/06-rogue.webp#card)
When you hit a target with a weapon attack while holding this card, you can deal an extra `6d6` force damage to that target. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Sage
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/07-sage.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Contact Other Plane](compendium/spells/contact-other-plane.md) spell. When you cast the spell in this way, your questions are answered by the mysterious figure depicted on the card. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Fates
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/08-fates.webp#card)
As a bonus action, you can brandish this card at one willing creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself, granting the creature a brief glimpse of the future. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Knight
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/09-knight.webp#card)
As an action, you can throw this card to an unoccupied space on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the card magically transforms into a [deck defender](compendium/bestiary/construct/deck-defender-bmt.md) (see "chapter 9" for its stat block) for up to 1 minute or until you use an action to speak the command word again, whereupon it transforms back into a card. The deck defender obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, it takes the [Dodge](rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and moves to avoid danger. The deck defender reverts to a card early if it drops to 0 hit points. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Sun

Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/17-donjon.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, or it vanishes, transported to a prison on another plane of existence. After 1 minute, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Void
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/18-void.webp#card)
As an action, you can brandish this card and attempt to banish up to three creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself.

Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Skull
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/BMT/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things/19-skull.webp#card)

You can use this card to summon a devil. The card is attuned to a specific devil with a challenge rating of 8 or lower. As an action, you can hold this card aloft and summon that devil, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The devil is initially unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. The DM has the creature's stat block. On each of your turns, you can issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you), and as long as you are holding this card, the devil obeys your commands. Otherwise, it is under the DM's control and acts according to its nature—it might attack you if it thinks it can prevail or try to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for further service. After 1 minute or when the devil's hit points drop to 0, the devil returns to the Lower Planes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Talons

As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [petrified](rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition (instead of the [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition) until it is removed by the [Greater Restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
