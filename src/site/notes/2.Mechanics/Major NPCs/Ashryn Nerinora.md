An epic battle occurred between her and [[2.Mechanics/Deities/Gosh\|Gosh]], three years ago, and she was killed. He later succame to his necrotic wounds, but then ascended to minor Godhood to become the head of the [[2.Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Order of Rotor\|Order of Rotor]]. 
She was resurrected by the [[2.Mechanics/Bestiary/Dark Wurm\|Dark Wurm]] as a banshee and has now taken over.

She is in a room with labyrinth features, she can jump through walls and strike. Her wail only needs to be heard. Pay attention to line of sight and sound
