## Characteristics

### Personality Traits

- Truly believes in the monarchy and the power of power structures. 
- I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.

### Ideals

- **Freedom** - I don't believe individuals are meant to be restricted and will fight to free those who are chained and destroy those who forge the chains. (Chaotic) 

### Bonds

- **Greatest** - I aim to become the greatest thief that ever walked the realm. I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.

### Flaws

- **Steal** - I am attracted to valuable things and constantly think about how to steal them. When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it.

## Enemies

The Temple of Sune is pissed at Chance as he stole a particularly "holy" chalice from a temple.
