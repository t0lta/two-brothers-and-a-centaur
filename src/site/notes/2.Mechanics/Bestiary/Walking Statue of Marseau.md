# Walking Statue of Waterdeep
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 219*  

Scattered throughout Waterdeep are eight enormous statues that can defend the city in times of great peril. Because they are so destructive, the walking statues are used only to fend off armies and seemingly insurmountable foes.

Each statue has a name and a unique appearance (see "The Walking Statues"), but in terms of statistics they are similar. The statue known as the Swordmaiden is too broken to be animated, and only the wielder of the Blackstaff (see appendix A) can animate the other seven.

## Landmarks

Over the years, Waterdavians have built structures around and on top of several of the statues, believing them to be little more than landmarks at this point. In their inanimate state, the statues pose little danger-but any structures attached to a walking statue are destroyed the first time it animates.
