The newest god to the pantheon. Little is known about him, but he is being accepted as the god of things broken and put back together and shifters. 

	He is both a horse and a man at the same time, through illusion. His narrow eyes are ash-gray. He has iron-gray skin. He is usually portrayed as wearing an utilitarian costume made from the skin of an ancient monster. He carries a sundial. He has seven faces which all stare in different directions, showing different emotions. He has eight pairs of bird-like wings. He can ease the pain of those transformed against their will. He sometimes takes the form of a living building.
