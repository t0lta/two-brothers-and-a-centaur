This patron adopted [[1.Players/Baltazar Hooke\|Baltazar Hooke]] after he interacted with the [[2.Mechanics/Items/Card of the Vizer\|Card of the Vizer]]. Seems to contain benefits and drawbacks

## The Deck of Many Things 
You have come into contact with a card from the Deck of Many Things, and it has affected you beyond its normal power.
The Deck has chosen you specifically to fufil its goals, wheter to reunte the entire deck, to destroy it's creator Asteria, or something else entirely.

### Cartomancy
*1st-level Deck Feature*

Your tarot deck grants you the ability to pierce through the veil of fate. The following spells are considered known Warlock spells for you and do not count against your total number of known spells.
##### Tarot Spells
| Warlock Level | Spells|
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Detect Evil and Good, Spray of Cards |
| 3rd  | Locate Object |
| 5th | Speak with Dead |
| 7th | Locate Creature |
| 9th | Contact Other Plane |

### Devil's Gamble
*1st-level Deck Feature*

At 1st level, the Major Arcana cards from your tarot deck begin to manifest weal and woe for you. 
At the end of each long rest, draw and and set down a number of Major Arcana cards equal to your proficiency bonus. You may activate these cards to use their associated abilities. 

Once a card has been activated, it is now the possession of the DM to use as they see fit. Once activated in this way, the card cannot be used again until a long rest

### Stacking the Deck
*1st-level Deck Feature*

Also at first level, the Deck has skewed your fate in your favor. 
When you cast Eldritch Blast, instead of rolling d10 for damage, draw a card from your deck of 52 Playing Cards.

A value of 2-10 is equivalent to that number of damage. Treat all face cards and Ace as a 10.
On pulling an Ace, your Eldritch Blast has an additional effect:

| Ace | Effect|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Spade  | Immediately fire another Eldritch Blast at an enemy|
| Heart  |  Your ally's next attack roll has advantage  |
| Club | Your ally's next attack roll has disadvantage |
| Diamond | Immediately fire another Eldritch Blast at an ally |
|Joker (logo) | all Eldritch blast damage for the next minute is doubled|
|Joker| all Eldritch blast damage for the next minute is halved|

### Fortuneteller's Focus
*3rd-level Pact Boon Option*

Upon choosing this boon, you (and your player) gain a magical deck of cards. This deck cannot be destroyed, and when lost return to your hand after a long rest. You can use this deck as a spellcaster's focus.

While the deck is in your possession, you have proficiency in games of chance and the *Performance* skill.
##### Pact Boons
A different choice of pact boon will manifest as a Tarot suit.
* Blade - Your pact weapon materializes from Swords cards.
* Chain - Your familiars are branded with Pentacles cards.
* Talisman - Your talisman is a Chalices card.
* Tome - Your extra spells are stored in Wands cards.

### Major Arcana
*6th-level Tarot Feature*

At 6th level, you no longer need to share your expended card with the DM.
In addition, once per day as an action you may sacrifice a Major Arcana card, discarding it without activating it. If used in this way, you regain one Warlock spell slot at your highest level.

### Improved Reading
*10th-level Tarot Feature*

At 10th level, your tarot readings have improved, giving you greater insight into the near future. When you use your Fortuneteller's Focus feature, you may cast Divination as a 10-minute ritual. You may use this feature this way once per long rest.

### Luck of the Draw
*14th-level Tarot Feature*

At 14th level, you have learned to exert your power on the cards, influencing the future. When you use a Major Arcana card, you may immediately draw another card and use that card's ability as a free action on your turn.
