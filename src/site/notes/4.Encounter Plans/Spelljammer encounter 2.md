## Traits

***Antimagic Cone.*** The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the [antimagic field](compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`4d6`) piercing damage.

***Eye Rays.*** The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:

- **1. Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.  
- **2. Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **3. Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **4. Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **5. Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (`8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **6. Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  

    If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  
- **7. Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  
- **8. Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained). It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#petrified) until freed by the  [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other magic.  
- **9. Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (`10d8`) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.  

    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  
- **10. Death Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (`10d10`) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  

## Legendary Actions

The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Eye Ray.*** The beholder uses one random eye ray.

# Space Clown
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 54*  

Space clowns are the inhabitants of a Wildspace system known as Clownspace. The humans who once inhabited the system's three ring-shaped worlds placed their faith in a god of revelry. Their worship ceremonies were centered on festivals and frivolity. Over time, the people's happiness hinged on the ever-increasing consumption of an elixir called Thrill Joy. Only after they became addicted did they discover that the priests of their faith had distilled the elixir from demonic ichor and the nectar of the bozo flower. Eventually, Thrill Joy transformed the faithful into fiendish creatures and "blessed" them with clown-like appearances.

Space clowns acquired their first spelljamming helms from dohwar merchants (see " Dohwar "). Subsequent visits to other Wildspace systems led to contact with a multitude of other folk. In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves.

Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated ships and sometimes take up residence on populated worlds, where they set up carnival tents to lure curious onlookers into their clutches. They are armed with colorfully painted ray guns that work only for them; these toys are harmless in the hands of anyone else.

|16 (+3)|16 (+3)|14 (+2)|11 (+0)|11 (+0)|16 (+3)|

- **Proficiency Bonus** +2

- **Skills** Acrobatics +5, Performance +5, Sleight of Hand +5
- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10
- **Languages** Abyssal, Common
- **Challenge** 2

## Traits

***Dying Burst.*** When the clown drops to 0 hit points, it pops like a balloon, releasing a splash of putrid, corrosive ichor. Each creature within 5 feet of the clown when it bursts must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Squeakers.*** The clown wears shoes that squeak when it walks. The squeaking can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. The squeaking is silenced while the clown's Phantasmal Form is in effect.

***Spellcasting.*** The clown casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability:

**At will**: [friends](compendium/spells/friends.md), [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md)

**1/day each**: [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md), [spider climb](compendium/spells/spider-climb.md)

## Actions

***Shock.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`4d6 + 3`) lightning damage.

***Ray Gun.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage, and if the target is a Humanoid with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target perceives everything it sees or hears as hilariously funny and is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Bonus Actions

***Phantasmal Form (3/Day).*** The clown veils itself and everything it is wearing and carrying in an illusion that makes it look like some other creature of its size or smaller (such as a child) or an object small enough to fit in the clown's space (such as a floating balloon). Maintaining this effect requires the clown's [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), and the illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. As an action, a creature that can see the clown's illusory form can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, piercing the illusion and discerning the clown's true form on a success.
