At the start of each turn roll a d6.
Also reset initiative each round.

After a certain point, time freezes. the players find themselves in a hallway - a portal on the left shows them fighting years ago, clearly losing. A portal on the right shows them fighting in the far future, clearly winning. They must each describe a memory of the past or future to gain a boon.

As a reaction, the dragon can force the attacker back to the spot they were at any previous point. If they occupy the space of another being, they both take 3d10 force damage. 

Time Breath:
The dragon exhales a shimmering **temporal wave** in a **90-foot cone**. Each creature in that area must make a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw** or suffer one of the following effects (roll 1d4):

1. **Aging Surge** – The creature ages **2d10 years** and takes **55 (10d10) radiant damage**.

2. **Temporal Stasis** – Nothing happens immediately. The next time the player does damage, they take double the amount given.

3. **Reverse Time** – The creature **loses its last turn**, undoing any actions taken (including movement and spellcasting).

4. **Time Warp** – The creature takes **44 (8d10) force damage** and is **pushed 30 feet** in a random direction.

  

A creature that **saves successfully** takes half damage and avoids additional effects.
