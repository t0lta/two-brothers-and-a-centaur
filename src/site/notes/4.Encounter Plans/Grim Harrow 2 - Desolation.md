**The Maze of Desolation (2d6)**

Characters roll a 2d6 in each room. for each successful encounter, they can add 1 to the number rolled

**2. Entrance** – piles of bodies, all alive but emotionally dead reaching away from the door. abaond hope, all ye who enter

**3-5. Depressed Whispers**: As the party navigates the maze, they begin to hear faint, mournful whispers. These whispers seem to come from the walls themselves and tell fragmented stories of Jyn Corvis’s past and her desperate desire to end her existence.
**Challenge**: The whispers can distract the party, imposing disadvantage on Perception checks. Additionally, the whispers might convey false information, leading the party into traps or dead ends.

**6. Bodies –** A sad display of depressed humanoids who cant move on. One of them is holding a crude map. +1 to number

**7-8** **Guardian of the Key**: **Description**: A room in the maze is guarded by two [[compendium/bestiary/undead/deathlock-mastermind-mpmm\|Deathlock Mastermind]] who serves Jyn Corvis.
**Challenge**: This guardian holds a key or artifact necessary to reach Jyn. The party must defeat or negotiate with the guardian, who may offer cryptic hints about Jyn’s true desires and weaknesses. One is a paladin sworn to keep the champion imprisoned, the other hates and is arrogant towards adventurers. will tell the answer to the riddle

**9 Dead end –** A conspicuous pile of treasure. 10 golden skulls surrounding a real skull, distended and horrible looking. taking more than 5 will  

**10 Echoes of Destruction**: The party stumbles upon an area where reality seems to be breaking down. Objects flicker in and out of existence, and the ground shifts unpredictably.
• **Challenge**: Navigating this area requires Intelligence saving throws to avoid being caught in temporal loops or illusions. The party might encounter time-displaced versions of themselves or past adventurers who failed to defeat Jyn.

**11-12 Void Pit**: **Description**: The party comes across a void in the center of the room. 40 feet across, 1/2 speed across. STR check to be pulled to the center. 6d6 damage each turn. This void seems to suck all light and hope from the surroundings.

**13+ The Temple of the Desolation –** "the key will tear me open. can get the key, can also drop a tear into the door. as you approach the door you realize gravity allows you to stand on it"

The storm lasts until the start of the champion's next turn. While the storm is active, the area of the storm is difficult terrain. Whenever a creature enters the storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) slashing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. |         |         |                          |         |         |

| **Furious Pursuit.** The champion moves up to its speed or commands its mount to move up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.<br>    <br>**Induce Violence**. The champion targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or immediately make one melee weapon attack against another creature of the champion's choice that is within the target's reach. If no creature is within the target's reach or if the target has the [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb) condition, the target instead takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage.<br>    <br>**Menace (Costs 2 Actions)**. The champion chooses any number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or have the [frightened](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#frightened_phb) condition until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                                   |         |         |                          |         |         |
