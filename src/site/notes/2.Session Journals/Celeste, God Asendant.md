The party, along with [[2.Mechanics/Major NPCs/Celeste\|Celeste]], continued their explorations of the Hallway of Og. 
First they entered the Icy Heaert of Eternity, where a sapphire was mounted inside the head of a red dragon. Caex flew up and retreevied the sapphire, which blasted him with Cone of Cold. Thanks to the Oath of the Watchers, the party escaped before any enimies could spring traps.

Next, they entered the cottage of Rafferty, a hidden [[compendium/bestiary/fiend/rakshasa\|rakshasa]], where he invited them in warmly. He offered cookies, even using [[compendium/spells/suggestion\|suggestion]] to tempt the players. Gus caused a flour explosion, distracting Rafferty while Balt engaged him in a game of dragon chess. Caex tried to grab the scrying bowl, but a [[compendium/bestiary/construct/rug-of-smothering\|rug-of-smothering]] snatched him up. At this point, Gus Abjured the fiend, sending him to a corner for time out. The party escaped, beefore realizing that the gem they had was false. A detect magic from Celeste showed the location of the true gem, while Caex grabbed it before Rafferty was free. 

The players entered A Gambler's Hustle, wheere a roudy crowd was taking bets on an assassin and a gladiator. The party watched as the assassin won, and then Balt stepped up to win the title. He eeasily Rebuked the fighter, snatching hte blade with the gem. A goblin lich then emerged, claming the knife and Balt as his champion. The crowd grew estatic, harming and holding some of the players, while the lich held the brothers. A [[compendium/spells/mass-suggestion\|Mass Suggestion]] cast on the crowd convinced them to leave, while the players were able to neutralize the lich. Caex found [[2.Mechanics/Items/____'s Spellbook\|____'s Spellbook]].

The final room was a giant cat playground, where a fiendish panther was stalking in the dark. Some of the players convinced the cat to go to sleep, while Caex was stumped by a riddle and extracted the wrong gem. A [[compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding\|Glyph of Warding]] exploded, triggering battle with the feline grappling Balt. 

After a long day of battle, Celeste offered to heal the party. As she gave them a long rest, a deep sleep fell over hte party. When they awoke, Celeste was almost complete with a ritual to Ascend to her brother's position as a god, erasing all memory of him.

A long and intense battle followed, with divine tax brackets harming the players. [[compendium/spells/sunburst\|sunburst]] blinded the palyers, while [[compendium/spells/harm\|harm]] dealt massive damage. A [[compendium/spells/death-ward\|Death Ward]] and [[compendium/spells/power-word-heal\|Power Word Heal]] put celeste back in the game, in the end, only Balt was standing with 1 hit point. He dealt the final blow with the shit-halu'ud poison, striking the divinity from Celeste. 

Gus healed Celeste, starting hte road to forgiveness.

Balt drew [[2.Mechanics/Items/The Chariot Card\|The Chariot Card]], allowing any one event to be rewinded in time.
