the adult sapphire dragon [[2.Mechanics/Major NPCs/Eir-Aryz\|Eir-Aryz]] and the ancient time dragon arrive from opposite directions and redshift / blue shift into one being of immense power 
He arrives as Caex is leaving town, and rends a huge portion of the city back into the past (beautiful elven city) and some into the future ruins and decay)
