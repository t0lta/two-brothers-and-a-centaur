## Backstory
Centaur of the court of [[2.Mechanics/Major NPCs/King Bartholomew Hooke\|King Bartholomew Hooke]]. 
Left a life of jousting, where he fabricated an excellent costume to appear as a man on a horse.
	The King eventally saw through the ruse, but instead of punishing him, entrusted the safety of his son [[1.Players/Baltazar Hooke\|Baltazar Hooke]] in his care
Took an oath as a [[compendium/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-crown-scag\|Oath of the Crown]] [[compendium/tables/paladin-ggr\|Paladin]].
Has two sons 
Has mighty hooves from which he smites.
He sleeps in the stables, not because he wants to but nobody has asked him otherwise

## Characteristics

### Personality
I strongly dislike dire horses because I fought one. And it was scary.
### Flaws
I have become so immersed in my gladiator persona that I find it hard to separate
### Ideals
I have grown tired of fighting and fame and wish to leave the past behind me. (by being a protector rather than a fighter)
### Bonds 
ACAB 
I have sworn to oppose the government that made me a gladiator

## Tenets
**_Law._** The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.

**_Loyalty._** Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.

**_Courage._** You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?

**_Responsibility._** You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

## Items
Has [[compendium/items/horseshoes-of-a-zephyr\|horseshoes-of-a-zephyr]] which allow him to fly. These shoes are a +1 weapon attached to his feet, allowing him to smite through a horse charge.
Has a [[compendium/optional-features/returning-weapon-tce\|Returning Weapon]] of a trident.

## Enemies
Dire Horses
Was disturbed by [[2.Mechanics/Major NPCs/Whispered Court/Belladonna\|Belladonna]]'s knowledge about themselves
