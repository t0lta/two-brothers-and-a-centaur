# Cloak of Displacement
*Wondrous Item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), or otherwise unable to move.

# Robe of the Archmagi
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  


This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe's color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can't attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn't correspond to your alignment.

You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:

- If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.  
- You have advantage on saving throws against spell and other magical effects.  
- Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.

# Staff of the Magi
*Staff, major, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains `4d6 + 2` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 20, the staff regains `1d12 + 1` charges.

## Spell Absorption

While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: [conjure elemental](compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) (7 charges), [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (3 charges), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [flaming sphere](compendium/spells/flaming-sphere.md) (2 charges), [ice storm](compendium/spells/ice-storm.md) (4 charges), [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) (2 charges), [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md) (2 charges), [lightning bolt](compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [passwall](compendium/spells/passwall.md) (5 charges), [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) (7 charges), [telekinesis](compendium/spells/telekinesis.md) (5 charges), [wall of fire](compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md) (4 charges), or [web](compendium/spells/web.md) (2 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: [arcane lock](compendium/spells/arcane-lock.md), [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [enlarge/reduce](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), [light](compendium/spells/light.md), [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md), or [protection from evil and good](compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

## Retributive Strike

You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50% chance chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

| Distance from Origin | Damage |
|----------------------|--------|
| 10 ft. away or closer | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |

# Broom of Flying
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
