> Though the name of the champion who wielded Mythcarver has been lost, legend says that the songs she sung in her beautiful contralto made her friends rejoice and her enemies weep with fear. Mythcarver was forged in the flying city of Zemniaz by a master arcanist and blacksmith along with the wielder herself, who wove song and spell into the blade with each fold of the metal.

This incredible silvered blade once belonged to the legendary White Duke, a founding member of the "Golden Grin", and many other master bards before him. It resonates with nearby musical tones. In the modern era, it is best known as the personal weapon of famed bard [Scanlan Shorthalt](compendium/bestiary/npc/scanlan-shorthalt-tdcsr.md).

## Dormant

While Mythcarver is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This longsword's enchantments and light construction also grant it the Finesse property, which allows you to use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls when making an attack with this weapon.

Additionally, when you target an ally with your Bardic Inspiration feature, you gain advantage on attacks with this weapon until the end of your turn.

## Awakened

When Mythcarver reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d6` force damage.  
- When you use your Bardic Inspiration to affect an enemy while wielding this sword, that enemy has disadvantage on their next saving throw.
