# Ornithopter of Flying
*Wondrous Item, very rare*  

- **Weight**: 25.0 lbs.

You can use this contraption to fly, provided your weight (including whatever you are wearing or carrying) doesn't exceed 300 pounds. The ornithopter has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it moves according to your spoken directions while you are riding it. It can't hover. If the ornithopter loses its rider while airborne, it falls and can't fly again for `1d6 + 4` days.

The ornithopter is 8 feet long, has a 14-foot wingspan, and weighs 25 pounds.
