# Infiltrator's Key (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

## Dormant

The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- The key can be used as [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.  
- While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to move silently.
