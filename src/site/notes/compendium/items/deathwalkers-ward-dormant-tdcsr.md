# Deathwalker's Ward (Dormant)
*Light Armor, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + DEX
- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

This beautiful black leather armor is covered in intricate scrollwork, and has a mantle bearing the black feathers of The Matron of Ravens. Legends say that it has been worn by a number of that deity's champions over the centuriesâ€”most recently, [Vax'ildan of Vox Machina](compendium/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md).

## Dormant

When the Deathwalker's Ward is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and you have advantage on death saving throws while wearing the armor.
