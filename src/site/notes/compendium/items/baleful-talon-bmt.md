# Baleful Talon
*Melee Weapon, very rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hooked, obsidian dagger.

When you hit a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 19 or 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the dagger flares with sickly light. The creature takes `6d6` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature disintegrates into dust.
