# Documancy Satchel
*Wondrous Item, varies*  


At rank 2, your documancy satchel becomes a common magic item, allowing you to magically send and receive documents to and from Head Office through a special pouch. Your documancy satchel magically produces prewritten and signature-ready contracts at your request, covering most common contractual needs. It also occasionally produces sticky notes printed with useful information and inspirational quotes from Head Office.

## Satchel of Holding

At rank 3, your documancy satchel gains additional features and becomes an uncommon magic item. One of the satchel's pouches now functions as a [bag of holding](compendium/items/bag-of-holding.md).

Additionally, you can use an action to draw forth from the documancy satchel a [spell scroll](compendium/items/spell-scroll.md) of [comprehend languages](compendium/spells/comprehend-languages.md). The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it appears. This property of the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Scroll Humidor

At rank 4, your documancy satchel gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. Within the satchel, a dedicated extradimensional space can hold up to thirty documents or [spell scrolls](compendium/items/spell-scroll.md). Placing a single document into the scroll humidor is an action. Drawing forth a desired scroll is a bonus action.
