# Mithral +1 Armor
*Generic Variant, rare*  


You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
