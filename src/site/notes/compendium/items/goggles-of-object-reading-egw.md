# Goggles of Object Reading
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Arcana](rules/skills.md#Arcana)) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.

In addition, you can cast the [identify](compendium/spells/identify.md) spell using the googles. Once you do so, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
