# Feywrought Armor
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


This colorful, flowery armor was forged in the Feywild and is infused with that plane's captivating magic.

While wearing this armor, you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition on yourself.

This armor has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend a charge to cast the [Compulsion](compendium/spells/compulsion.md) spell (save DC 15) from this armor. The armor regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
