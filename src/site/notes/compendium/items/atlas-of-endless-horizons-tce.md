# Atlas of Endless Horizons
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick book is bound in dark leather, crisscrossed with inlaid silver lines suggesting a map or chart. When found, the book contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: [arcane gate](compendium/spells/arcane-gate.md), [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md), [gate](compendium/spells/gate.md), [misty step](compendium/spells/misty-step.md), [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md), [teleportation circle](compendium/spells/teleportation-circle.md), and [word of recall](compendium/spells/word-of-recall.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.  
- When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If your new position is out of range of the attack, it misses you.
