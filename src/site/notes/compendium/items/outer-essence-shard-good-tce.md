# Outer Essence Shard (Good)
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

## Property

You or one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you gains `3d6` temporary hit points.
