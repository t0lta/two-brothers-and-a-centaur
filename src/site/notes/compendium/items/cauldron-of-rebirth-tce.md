# Cauldron of Rebirth
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)*  


This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a [potion of greater healing](compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md). The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.
