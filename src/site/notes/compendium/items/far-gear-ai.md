# Far Gear
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks.

## Aberrant Ally

You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the [conjure celestial](compendium/spells/conjure-celestial.md) spell (no [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Unnatural Bane

You can cast the [bane](compendium/spells/bane.md) spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Part of a Whole

While this component is not installed in the [Orrery of the Wanderer](compendium/items/orrery-of-the-wanderer-ai.md), its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
