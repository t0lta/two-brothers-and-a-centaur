# Dragon's Wrath Weapon
*Generic Variant, varies (requires attunement)*  


This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
