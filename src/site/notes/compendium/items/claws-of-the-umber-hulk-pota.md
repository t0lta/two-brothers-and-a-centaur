# Claws of the Umber Hulk
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


These heavy gauntlets of brown iron are forged in the shape of an [umber hulk's](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/umber-hulk.md) claws, and they fit the wearer's hands and forearms all the way up to the elbow. While wearing both claws, you gain a burrowing speed of 20 feet, and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round.

You can use a claw as a melee weapon while wearing it. You have proficiency with it, and it deals `1d8` slashing damage on a hit (your Strength modifier applies to the attack and damage rolls, as normal).

While wearing the claws, you can't manipulate objects or cast spells with somatic components.
