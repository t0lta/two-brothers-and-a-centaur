# Breathing Bubble
*Wondrous Item, common*  


This translucent, bubble-like sphere has a slightly tacky outer surface, and you gain the item's benefits only while wearing it over your head like a helmet.

The bubble contains 1 hour of breathable air. The bubble regains all its expended air daily at dawn.
