# Elemental Gem, Yellow Diamond
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  


This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an [earth elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) is summoned as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell, and the gem's magic is lost.
