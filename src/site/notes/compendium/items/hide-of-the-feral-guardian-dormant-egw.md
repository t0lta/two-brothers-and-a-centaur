# Hide of the Feral Guardian (Dormant)
*Light Armor, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + DEX
- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melora, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

## Dormant

While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor grants you a +1 bonus to AC.  
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, you have a +1 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls, and you retain the benefits of this armor.  
- As an action, you can use the armor to cast [polymorph](compendium/spells/polymorph.md) on yourself, transforming into a [giant owl](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md) while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
