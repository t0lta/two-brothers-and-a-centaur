# Nature's Mantle
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is lightly obscured, you can [Hide](rules/actions.md#Hide) as a bonus action even if you are being directly observed.
