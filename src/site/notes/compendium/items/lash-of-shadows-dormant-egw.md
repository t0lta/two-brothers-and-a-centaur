# Lash of Shadows (Dormant)
*Melee Weapon, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), Martial, [Reach](rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.

## Sentience

The Lash of Shadows is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and [darkvision](rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.

## Personality

A mad [marilith](compendium/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) named Sizlifeth lives within the Lash of Shadows. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.

## Dormant

The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
- You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:  
-     - **Dead Eyes.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. While [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded).    
        - **Serpent Venom.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes `3d6` poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.    

> [!note] Betrayer Artifact Properties
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and one [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and an additional [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [major beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.{ #betrayer-artifact-properties}
