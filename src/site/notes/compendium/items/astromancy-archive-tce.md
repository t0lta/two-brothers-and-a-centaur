# Astromancy Archive
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings unfolds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action, you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to it: [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md), [divination](compendium/spells/divination.md), [find the path](compendium/spells/find-the-path.md), [foresight](compendium/spells/foresight.md), [locate creature](compendium/spells/locate-creature.md), and [locate object](compendium/spells/locate-object.md). It functions as a spellbook for you, with spells encoded on the rings.

While you are holding the archive, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The archive has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the archive, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the archive. The new spell must be of the divination school.  
- When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and force the creature to roll a `d4` and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the original roll. You can do this after you see the roll but before its effects are applied.
