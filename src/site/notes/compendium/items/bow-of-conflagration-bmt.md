# Bow of Conflagration
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


Ammunition fired from this bow blazes brightly. When you hit with an attack roll using this bow, the target takes an extra `1d6` fire damage. If the target is a flammable, nonmagical object, it catches fire, taking `1d6` fire damage at the start of each of your turns until a creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.
