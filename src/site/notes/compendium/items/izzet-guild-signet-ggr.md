# Izzet Guild Signet
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This ring, adorned with the symbol of Izzet, allows you to cast [chaos bolt](compendium/spells/chaos-bolt-xge.md). A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Izzet's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
