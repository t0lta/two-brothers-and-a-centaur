Crafted from a single piece of obsidian, this warhammer of Torog hums with magical energy and is carved with the images of faces screaming in pain.

## Sentience

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal.

## Personality

A covetous [ultroloth](compendium/bestiary/fiend/ultroloth.md) named Ciria lives within Grovelthrash. The weapon values material possessions and doling out pain. It compliments its wielder whenever they claim treasure and takes pleasure in harming others.

## Dormant

The warhammer grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this warhammer, you can deal an extra `2d6` bludgeoning damage to the target. If you do, you take `1d6` psychic damage. The warhammer deals double damage to objects and structures.  
- While holding this weapon, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks made to discern a lie spoken in a language you understand.

In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and one [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and an additional [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property.

## Awakened

When the warhammer reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.  
- You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed. You can use your burrowing speed to move through sand, loose earth, mud, or ice, not solid rock.  
- When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you hits you with an attack while you are wielding the warhammer, you can use your reaction to deal an amount of psychic damage to that creature equal to the damage you took from the attack. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
