# Pixie Dust
*Wondrous Item, uncommon*  


As an action, you can sprinkle this dust on yourself or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The recipient gains a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover for 1 minute. If the creature is airborne when this effect ends, it falls safely to the ground, taking no damage and landing on its feet.

A small packet holds enough pixie dust for one use.
