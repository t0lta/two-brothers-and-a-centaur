# Cabal's Ruin
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

This cloak is made of heavy dark cloth trimmed with golden patterns, and occasionally shimmers with sparks of arcane energy. It was once worn by the famed gunslinger [Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md).
