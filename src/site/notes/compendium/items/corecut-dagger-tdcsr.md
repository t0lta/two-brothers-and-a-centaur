# Corecut Dagger
*Melee Weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This dark metal blade bends in a wicked, hooked curve. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can spend 1 Hit Die to deal an extra `3d6` necrotic damage.

## Curse

This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify](compendium/spells/identify.md) spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.
