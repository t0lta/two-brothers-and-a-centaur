# Honor's Last Stand (Dormant)
*Shield, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

> [!note] Rules Tip: Pushing and Shoving
> 
> Certain character options, such as the Path of the Juggernaut barbarian in "chapter 4", grant the ability to push other creatures around the battlefield with your attacks. But this is just one way to push a creature. If you want to move a creature without hurting it, there's a [special shove attack](rules/actions.md#shove) available to all characters. The "Vestige of Divergence" Honor's Last Stand encourages you to shove your foes away while you valiantly stand your ground.

This massive silvered shield bears the crest of The Platinum Dragon and never tarnishes. Its metal is always warm to the touch.

## Dormant

While Honor's Last Stand is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while holding the shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. You also can't be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) while bearing this shield.
