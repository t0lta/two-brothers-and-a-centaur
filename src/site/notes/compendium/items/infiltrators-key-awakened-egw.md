# Infiltrator's Key (Awakened)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

## Dormant

The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- The key can be used as [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.  
- While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to move silently.  

## Awakened

When the Infiltrator's Key reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.  
- While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [alter self](compendium/spells/alter-self.md), [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md), or [pass without trace](compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md). Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
