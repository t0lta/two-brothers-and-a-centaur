- As an action, you can use the armor to cast [polymorph](compendium/spells/polymorph.md) on yourself, transforming into a [giant owl](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md) while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  

## Awakened

When the armor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The AC bonus of the armor increases to +2.
