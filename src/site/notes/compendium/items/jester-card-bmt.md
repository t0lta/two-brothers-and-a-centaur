# Jester Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Otto's Irresistible Dance](compendium/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md) spell (save DC 17), and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
