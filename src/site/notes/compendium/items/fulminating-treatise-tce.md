# Fulminating Treatise
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [contingency](compendium/spells/contingency.md), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md), [gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md), [Leomund's tiny hut](compendium/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md), [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md), [thunderwave](compendium/spells/thunderwave.md), and [wall of force](compendium/spells/wall-of-force.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `2d6` force damage to the creature and knock the creature [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) if it is Large or smaller.
