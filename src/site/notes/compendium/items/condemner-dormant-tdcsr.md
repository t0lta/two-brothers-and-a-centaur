# Condemner (Dormant)
*Ranged Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Range**: 100/400
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Heavy](rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Loading](rules/item-properties.md#Loading), Martial, [Two-handed](rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed), [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 18.0 lbs.

This shadow-touched [heavy crossbow](compendium/items/heavy-crossbow.md) once served as the weapon of choice for the legendary assassin Todora. Though few know this, Condemner is now in the possession of an equally infamous assassin named "Ixrattu Khar".

## Dormant

When Condemner is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d4` poison damage.

Additionally, if you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can activate one of the following effects instead of dealing damage:

- You cast [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) centered on the target's space.  
- You cast [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) centered on the target's space.  

When an effect is used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
