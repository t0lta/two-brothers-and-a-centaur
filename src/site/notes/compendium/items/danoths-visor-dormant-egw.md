# Danoth's Visor (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) enemies and scout areas from afar.

## Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](rules/skills.md#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.
