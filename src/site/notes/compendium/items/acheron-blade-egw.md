# Acheron Blade
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


The black blade of this sword is crafted from a mysterious arcane alloy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you are immune to effects that turn undead.

## Dark Blessing

While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself `1d4 + 4` temporary hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dusk.

## Disheartening Strike

When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it's immune to the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition. Once you use this property, you can't do so again until the next dusk.
