# Eldritch Staff
*Melee Weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges and regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff is destroyed in an otherwise harmless burst of eldritch energy.

## Eldritch Attack

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra `1d8` lightning damage.

## Eldritch Escape

If you take damage while holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of the staff's charges, whereupon you turn [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) and teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You remain [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or deal damage.
