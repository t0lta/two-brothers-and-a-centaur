# Armor of the Fallen
*Generic Variant, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this armor, you can use it to cast either [Speak with Dead](compendium/spells/speak-with-dead.md) or [Animate Dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead.md). Once the armor has cast a spell in this way, it can't cast either spell until the next dawn.

Your soul keeps this armor together. If you die while you are attuned to the armor, the armor is destroyed.
