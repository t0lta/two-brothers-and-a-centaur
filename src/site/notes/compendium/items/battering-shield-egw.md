# Battering Shield
*Shield, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this iron tower shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

Additionally, the shield has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you are holding the shield and push a creature within your reach at least 5 feet away, you can expend 1 charge to push that creature an additional 10 feet, knock it [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone), or both.
