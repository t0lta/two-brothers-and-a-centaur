# Deck of Oracles
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


The illustrations on this deck of oracle cards move or change subtly when viewed indirectly. When you finish a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes consulting the cards for an omen of the coming day. Roll a `d20` and record the number rolled. Once in the next 8 hours, immediately after a creature within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to discard the `d20` roll; the creature must use the number you rolled in place of its roll.

Additionally, while holding the cards, you can cast [Divination](compendium/spells/divination.md) from them. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
