# Dragon Thighbone Club
*Melee Weapon, unknown (magic) (attunement optional)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Two-handed](rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Weight**: 250.0 lbs.

This red dragon's thighbone is 14 feet long, 250 lbs, and is wrapped in old leather, suggesting that it was once used as a giant's greatclub.

When you hit a creature of the dragon type with this weapon, it deals an extra `2d8` bludgeoning damage.

If you attune to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that you can wield effectively.
