You can make a ranged weapon attack with this magic shield. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, and it uses your Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll (your choice). If you're proficient with shields, you are proficient with attacks made using this shield. On a hit, it deals `1d6` slashing damage. If you throw the shield, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target.
